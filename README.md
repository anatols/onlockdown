# onlockdown.life
This repository contains source code for http://onlockdown.life website and the data fetcher used for it.

The idea is to have a single page app w/o backend support that will show days in lockdown with tally marks (a.k.a. prison calendar etc.). The page is hosted using Github Pages.

This project is nothing serious, just a Javascript refresher for me.

## Credits
